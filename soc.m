%% Script to create and initial 'unstable' weight matrix and a stability-optimised circuit

% This code creates an initial 'unstable' weight matrix W according to
% (Hennequin et al., Neuron, 2014) and then creates the stability-optimised
% variant so that the resulting neuronal dynamics display rich activity transients.
